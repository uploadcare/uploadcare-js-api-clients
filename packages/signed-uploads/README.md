## Install

```bash
npm install @uploadcare/signed-uploads
```

## Usage

**NOTE**: The Uploadcare API accepts `expire` as unix time in seconds. However, this library accepts time in milliseconds, as per the Node.js standard.

```typescript
import { generateSecureSignature } from '@uploadcare/signed-uploads'

// by the expiration timestamp in milliseconds since the epoch
const signature = generateSecureSignature('YOUR_SECRET_KEY', {
  expire: Date.now() + 60 * 30 * 1000 // 30 minutes
})

// by the lifetime in milliseconds
const signature = generateSecureSignature('YOUR_SECRET_KEY', {
  lifetime: 60 * 30 * 1000 // 30 minutes
})
```
